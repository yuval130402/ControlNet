# Final_Project - ControlNet
my 12th grade final project.

The system is designed for teachers / classroom administrators with a computer lab. 
The system enables convenient control and handling of students' computers in the classroom in real time.
The system allows the teacher to view the student screens, lock their computers, turn off and turn on the computers remotely, 
broadcast the teacher's screen to the student screens.

the system works on LAN multiple computers, Windows 10 os, Python 3.7+. It used a cmd windows tool which is called devcon, 
so download it and put the software file into the system32 directory in the windows directory.
